Rule (ContradictionElimination)
  Premise
    P \/ (Q /\ ¬Q)
  Conclusion
    P
  Proof
    Suppose
      P
    Therefore
      P
    P => P by ImplicationIntroduction
    Suppose
      Q /\ ¬Q
    Hence
      Q by ConjunctionRightElimination
      ¬Q by ConjunctionLeftElimination
    Therefore
      P by PrincipleOfExplosionAlternativeForm
    (Q /\ ¬Q) => P by ImplicationIntroduction
  Therefore
    P by DisjunctionElimination
