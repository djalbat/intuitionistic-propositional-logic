Metavariable Q:Statement

Rule (ContradictionElimination)
  Premise
    P ∨ (Q ∧ ¬Q)
  Conclusion
    P
  Proof
    Suppose
      P
    Then
      P
    P ⇒ P by ImplicationIntroduction
    Suppose
      Q ∧ ¬Q
    Hence
      Q by ConjunctionRightElimination
      ¬Q by ConjunctionLeftElimination
    Then
      P by PrincipleOfExplosionAlternativeForm
    (Q ∧ ¬Q) ⇒ P by ImplicationIntroduction
  Therefore
    P by DisjunctionElimination
